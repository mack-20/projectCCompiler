# My Own C Compiler *(Project mcc)*
===================================

## Motivation
==============
I am a programming enthusiast and I love to find out how things work.
I had had my fair share of C so I knew there was a process known as *__compilation__* going on in order for me to run my source files.
But I had no idea what actually happened during the _'compilation process'_. So I figured that I'd learn how to make a compiler in order to understand how it worked.
